## Prerequisites

Microsoft .NET Core 7.0 or later.

## Getting started

Decompress the folder, then open a terminal.

```
cd path/to/folder/Compiler
```

*Note : if the terminal starts in another drive, just type the name of the drive where the project folder is located, i.e. `D:`*

Once you are in the **Compiler** folder, run the program (a sample [source code file](Compiler/source.txt) is already provided).

```
dotnet run source.txt
```

And voilà !

## Appendix
